# StuyCraft
We are Budget Notch – With Stuyle!
Sadi Nirloy and Maya Nelson, APCS Period 4

Essentially, we’re creating Minecraft – except it’s 2D, there’s like 5 different blocks, and crafting is unheard of. Sounds fun, doesn’t it? You’ll spawn in a randomly generated, side-view world whose terrain has been created using the Perlin Noise algorithm. From there you can do many fun things such as: Break blocks. Place blocks. Explore biomes. Kill mobs. Eat food. And even die! If this sounds like your idea of a good time, then read on to learn more about StuyCraft!

Diary log thing

Maya **5/23** - Added class hierarchy system and created all of the files, as well as uploaded each of the images for each class. 

Sadi **5-23** : I worked to create the worldGeneration method. I added the necessary features to work on the creation of blocks of the worlds. This does not include subtypes of blocks.

Maya **5-24** - Designed health, hunger, hotbar, and tools, and implemented the display for each of them. Began working on break methods and adding an inventory system, which is still in progress.

Sadi**5-24**: Continued working on the World Generation by adding visuals and changing the use of Perlin noise. Also established the block subclasses and made the surface.

Maya **5-25** - Finished break method save for range and animation features. Began working on place.

Sadi **5-25**: Worked on establishing Biomes and gravity. Gravity and collision with the floor is incredibly frustrating. 

Maya **5-26** - Finished place method and hunger bar. Created tick system.
Sadi **5-26**: Continued working on the gravity collision and made a class like the Controller showed in class to smooth the movement. 

Sadi **5-27**: Made a change to the place and break methods that found the mouse’s coordinates in the world, rather than the screen

Maya **5-27** - Fixed hunger bar glitch and merged with main.

Maya **5-28** - Screamed at mobs.

Maya **5-29**- Worked on the mob class – added attack methods, health bars, and hopelessly failed at a smooth movement system. Also, modified tree creation and added death screen.

Sadi Nirloy **5-29**: Made improvements on the collisions and created trees and their spawning

Maya **5-30** - Finalized everything for the demo, and made some tweaks to mob movement. 

Sadi **5-30**: Made various edits for debugging and updated cave generation to have 2 kinds of caves
