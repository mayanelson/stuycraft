# StuyCraft
We are Budget Notch – With Stuyle!
Sadi Nirloy and Maya Nelson, APCS Period 4

Essentially, we’re creating Minecraft – except it’s 2D, there’s like 5 different blocks, and crafting is unheard of. Sounds fun, doesn’t it? You’ll spawn in a randomly generated, side-view world whose terrain has been created using the Perlin Noise algorithm. From there you can do many fun things such as: Break blocks. Place blocks. Explore biomes. Kill mobs. Eat food. And even die! If this sounds like your idea of a good time, then read on to learn more about StuyCraft!
